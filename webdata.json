Then, we develop the preconditioned generalized minimal residual (preconditioned GMRES) method and preconditioned conjugate gradient normal residual (preconditioned CGNR) method with easily constructed preconditioners. Importantly, because resulting systems are Toeplitz-like, fast Fourier transform can be applied to significantly reduce the computational cost. We perform numerical experiments to demonstrate the efficiency of our preconditioners, even in cases with variable coefficients."

However, to fully take advantages of these modern computer systems, we need to design algorithms by applying the properties of the target problems, the matrix structures, and the hardware architectures. In this talk, we focus on a direct linear system solver and a truncated singular value decomposition to show how we design new algorithms along the trend of fast-evolving processors and computer systems. The direct solver is called compressed hierarchical Schur algorithm (CHiS) and it is used to solve ill-conditioned linear systems arising in 3D photonic device simulations. The integrated singular value decomposition (iSVD) is designed to decompose large matrices arising in, for example, data analytics by using multiple random projections. Numerical results will be presented to show the advantages of the proposed algorithms."

In this talk, we will introduce the eigendecomposition of the discrete double-curl and the singular value decomposition of the discrete single-curl operator and how to apply these decompositions to tackle the computational challenges for solving the associated large-scale eigenvalue problems. Based on these theoretical results, we develop a MATLAB package: FAME to eﬃciently compute the associated band structure for the three-dimensional Maxwell’s equations.

Under a minor reformulation of the system we show that there is a continuous energy law underlying the system, assuming that all variables have reasonable regularities. For the reformulated system we then design a continuous finite element method and a special temporal scheme where the energy law is preserved at the discrete level. Such a discrete energy law (almost the same as the continuous energy law) for a variable density two-phase flow model has not been established before with a continuous finite element. Some numerical results will be presented to demonstrate the capabilities of our numerical schemes. We will also show how to develop an energy law preserving continuous finite element method for a moving contact line problem."

The approach is based on the conservative discrete ordinate method for velocity space by using Gauss Hermite or Simpson’s quadrature rule and conservation of macroscopic properties are enforced on the BGK collision operator. High-order asymptotic-preserving time integration is adopted and the spatial evolution is performed by high-order schemes including a finite difference weighted essentially non-oscillatory method and correction procedure via reconstruction schemes. An artificial viscosity dissipative model is introduced into the Boltzmann-BGK equation when the correction procedure via reconstruction scheme is used. The effects of the discrete velocity conservative property and accuracy of high-order formulations of kinetic schemes based on BGK model methods are provided. Extensive comparative tests with one-dimensional and two-dimensional problems in rarefied gas flows have been carried out to validate and illustrate the schemes presented. Potentially advantageous schemes in terms of stable large time step allowed and higher-order of accuracy are suggested."

Recently, Gu and Yau propose to compress the data using mean curvature H and conformal factor λ. In this work, we follow Gu and Yau’s idea and further apply it to 3D surface morphing and retargeting where matching landmark points on parametric domains, interpolating (H,λ) for generating remaining frames, and reconstructing 3D geometry and texture are essential. To dealt with point data merging and color calibration, we employee the ICP (iterative closest point) type of rigid registration and calibrate the color variations in the LAB color space.\n  In this talk, we shall brieﬂy review the theory of conformal global parametrization, the quaternion registration methods and optimization methods for color calibration. We shall also introduce the geodesic spline landmark matching using discrete Green function built by HCT ﬁnite element. Some of our numerical results will also be shown."

However, they may not work well for problems with singular solutions due to various facts such as corner singularities, non-matching boundary conditions, non-smooth coefficients. If the form of the singular expansion for the solution is known, we develop a Muntz Galerkin method which is based on specially tuned Muntz polynomials to deal with the singular behaviors of the underlying problems, and show that it provide optimal error estimates. On the other hand, if the Muntz Galerkin method is not applicable or efficient, we present a new extended spectral-Galerkin method which allows us to split it into two separate problems: one is to find an approximation for the smooth part by a usual spectral method, the other is to determine an approximation to the singular part with  terms by solving a  system. So the new method is very easy to implement, very efficient and is capable of providing very accurate approximations for a class of singular problems. We will present ample numerical results for a variety of problems with singular solutions, including fractional PDEs, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches."

The main idea of this approach is based on the introduction of a virtual force of discrete type, which is distributed on the whole solid body and appended to the fluid momentum equations to accommodate the no-slip boundary condition at the immersed solid boundary. More specifically, based on the rate of moment changes of the solid body, we first predict the virtual force at the grid points by using the difference between the prescribed solid velocities and the computed velocities which are obtained by applying the projection method to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on the whole domain in the absence of immersed solid object. This predicted virtual force is then added to the fluid momentum equations as an additional forcing term and again, we employ the projection method to correct the velocity field, pressure and virtual force. Such prediction-correction procedure can be iterated to generate a more general method, if necessary. Numerical experiments of several benchmark problems are performed to illustrate the simplicity and high performance of the prediction-correction approach. We find that our numerical results are in very good agreement with the previous works in the literature and in most cases, one correction step is good enough. This is joint work with Tzyy-Leng Horng, Po-Wen Hsieh and Cheng-Shu You."

            "abstract":"In this paper a three-step iterative solution algorithm for solving the two-component Camassa-Holm (2CH) equation, which involves only the first-order derivative terms, is presented. In the first solution step, the nonlinear convection equation for the timeevolving fluid velocity component along the horizontal direction is solved. In the second solution step, the equation to be solved is known as the inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation. Finally, the equation for modeling the transport of density is taken into account in the third solution step. The differential order of 2CH equation has been reduced in order to facilitate numerical scheme development in a comparatively smaller grid stencil. In this study, a new fifth-order spatially accurate upwinding combined compact difference scheme (UCCD5) which differs from that in [J. Comput. Phys. 230 (2011) 5399-5416] is developed in a four-point grid stencil for approximating the firstorder derivative term. For the purpose of retaining long-term discretely accurate Hamiltonians in the 2-component Camassa-Holm equation, the time integrator (or timestepping scheme) chosen in this study should conserve symplecticity. In addition to get a high resolution finite difference solution, we will in particular demonstrate the capability of applying the proposed numerical method to resolve the solutions of single peakon, peakon-antipeakon interaction and dam-break problems. We also address that both of the discrete Hamiltonians and Casimir functions are conserved well for all problems."
